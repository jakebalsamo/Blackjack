# Blackjack

This project started as a console-based game of Blackjack developed by me and a team of two others that has since expanded into a personal project dedicated to implementing a GUI while I explore the use of JavaFX. It is a single player (versus computer) implementation of the blackjack card game using standard rules, meant to be simple and lightweight, replicating the experience of playing at table in a casino.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was initially to complete a course assignment that required intensive use of object-oriented programming ideologies. It has since become motivation for myself to complete an actual graphical instance of a card game while learning JavaFX.

## Completion

Blackjack is still a work in progress, as I am still in college classes. I work on it frequently, but only recently decided to add my projects to github. I intend to complete this application in the future.
